# Brody Dingel's Master's Thesis

This repo hosts the R code used for carrying out statistical analyses in my Master's thesis. 

## The Dataset

The data for this thesis was formatted in two ways. First, the data for the paired t-tests included one line for each uniquely labeled participant with one column for their score on the related (R) quiz and one column for their score on the unrelated (NR) quiz. Second, the data for the logistic mixed-effects regression models were arranged such that each line included the following: Subject ID, Course, Section, Instructor, Item, Score (0, 1, or 2), and List Type (related or unrelated).
